Want to make a site using Jekyll and host it on GitHub Pages? You'll come to find quickly enough that only [a few plugins](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-jekyll-plugins-to-a-github-pages-site) are supported by GitHub Pages.

Now, there *are* a few workarounds to this, including [Kickster](http://kickster.nielsenramon.com/), but this site is to show you that it's possible to add some really cool plugin-like functionality using nothing but Liquid, HTML, JavaScript, and some libraries. So, if you're up for it, you can add some notPlugins to your Jekyll site, compatible with GitHub Pages.

At the moment, I'm adding new notPlugins as I think about them. Next on the docket are:
- A Clipboard Manipulator (for copy/paste)
- A PDF embedder
- An E-mail form
- A spreadsheet embedder
